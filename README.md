# Hydra Configuration Example
This is a simple project demonstrating how to use the Hydra framework for configuring Python applications.

## Setup
Before running the application, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:

```
pip install hydra-core omegaconf
```
## Structure
The project contains the following files:

main.py: This is the main Python script. It uses the Hydra framework to load a configuration file and print it.
conf/config.yaml: This is the configuration file. It is written in YAML and contains various configuration options for the application.

## Running the Application
To run the application, use the following command:

```
python my_app.py
```
This will print the configuration defined in config.yaml.
